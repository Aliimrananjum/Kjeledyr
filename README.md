# Kjeledyr
Created this webapp as preperation for exam in DATA1700 at OsloMet in 2022. Im currenty in my secound semester as a computer engineer student. So far I have learned Java, impimentation of Spring, Jquerry, bootstrap, vanilla JS, AJA, JSON and SQL.
Through this webapp I wanted to demonstrate my knowlegde on how to implement all the tools that I have learned to far.

Kjeledyr webapp is an simple page where the user can registrate their pets.
The main page allowes user to either sign inn with their prevoius account or create a new account if they dont already have one. Login page has multiple functions such as regEX, validation of password through bCrypt, and datasearch in DB.
The registration of user page has the same functionalites as login page, but the page aslo confirm if the username has already been created before, and if the postal code is valid.
After signing into kjeledyr webapp, the user can proeceed to add their pets.
Only the admin user can delete or edit a registration. This function is done through having session controll.
